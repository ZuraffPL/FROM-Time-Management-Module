## Technical Details

### Socket Events
The module uses `module.from-time-management` socket events for real-time synchronization:
- `updateAgentTracking`: Synchronizes all tracking data across clients
- `addActionToQueue`: Handles action requests from players to GM
- `requestCurrentData`: Player requests for current data sync

### Data Storage
The module uses a hybrid storage approach for maximum reliability:

#### File-Based Storage (v1.0.5+)
- **Agent Archives**: Individual JSON files per agent in world directory
  - Location: `Data/worlds/[world-name]/from-time-management-agent-[ID].json`
  - Contains complete action history with timestamps and details
  - Survives Foundry restarts and world reloads
  - Can be manually backed up, shared, or edited

#### Foundry Settings Storage (Backup)
All data also persists in Foundry's world settings as backup:
- `currentGameTime`: Current in-game time and date
- `agentTimeTracking`: Legacy total time tracking
- `agentDayTimeTracking`: Day-specific time tracking per agent
- `agentNightTimeTracking`: Night-specific time tracking per agent
- `trackingMode`: Current tracking mode (day/night)
- `actionQueue`: All queued and completed actions
- `actionArchive`: Complete historical archive (backup for file system)

### Performance
- Optimized for real-time updates without lag
- Efficient DOM manipulation and re-rendering
- Minimal network traffic through targeted socket events
