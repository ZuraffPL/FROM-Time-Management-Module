## Technical Details

### Socket Events
The module uses `module.from-time-management` socket events for real-time synchronization:
- `updateAgentTracking`: Synchronizes all tracking data across clients
- `addActionToQueue`: Handles action requests from players to GM
- `requestCurrentData`: Player requests for current data sync

### Data Storage
All data persists in Foundry's world settings:
- `currentGameTime`: Current in-game time and date
- `agentTimeTracking`: Legacy total time tracking
- `agentDayTimeTracking`: Day-specific time tracking per agent
- `agentNightTimeTracking`: Night-specific time tracking per agent
- `trackingMode`: Current tracking mode (day/night)
- `actionQueue`: All queued and completed actions
- `actionArchive`: Complete historical archive of all agent actions organized by agent and day

### Performance
- Optimized for real-time updates without lag
- Efficient DOM manipulation and re-rendering
- Minimal network traffic through targeted socket events

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/from-time-management.git
